# Small frontend task

## Task 1
We'd like to have a small frontend which lists all Pokémons which exists. Therefore, we have an [Pokémon Api](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2#info) or a node_module [pokenode-ts](https://github.com/Gabb-c/pokenode-ts).

In the list we'd like to see the name and the image (can be found inside sprites) of the Pokémon. You can use whatever you want (Table, Cards, or other components)

## Task 2
When clicking on one Pokémon we'd like to see some more information of this Pokémon (doesn't really matter which information, just some)
